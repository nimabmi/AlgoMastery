Welcome to **AlgoMastery**, a comprehensive collection of algorithm solutions for the **Top 150 LeetCode problems** frequently asked by top companies. This repository showcases my journey in mastering algorithms and data structures by solving, modifying, and optimizing popular coding challenges.

## üéØ Goal
The primary aim of this repository is to:
- Develop a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Provide clear, well-structured, and optimized solutions for the top 150 LeetCode problems.
- Document my thought process, optimizations, and approaches to each problem.
- Help others prepare for coding interviews by providing clear explanations and optimized solutions.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- Each problem is solved in **Python**, and I plan to include detailed comments and explanations within the code.
- Each problem solution has its own folder containing:
  - The **problem description**.
  - My **approach and optimizations**.
  - A **step-by-step breakdown** of the solution.
  - The **code solution**.

The folder structure is as follows:
